C Programming Language (Console App)
Our goal when making the Vehicle Sales System was to autonomously calculate all taxes of vehicles to be purchased 
(OTV, VAT, Engine Volume, etc.) to raise the final sales price to benefit the dealer. Note: this program is 
written to comply with the Republic of Turkey Duties and Taxes numbers and are 
calculated according to those values. Therefore, it will not accurately work in other countries with different numbers and values.
